Scott Caan Thesis
-------------

I was noticing a derth of thesis templates that addressed my needs. As such, I have modified the [MIT Latex Thesis](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/). Unfortunately, my "lorem ipsum" generator was on the fritz, so I did the next thing I could think of, and use actor Scott Caan and his likeness as placeholders. 

This is a LaTex version of the thesis format adapted from the MIT thesis guidelines. It has been rewritten to better suit the needs of candidates wishing to have an APA-like bibliography, better spacing and readabliity as well as being surfeit with Scott Caan images.
