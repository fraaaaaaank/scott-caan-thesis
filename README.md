Scott Caan Thesis
-------------

I was noticing a derth of thesis templates that addressed my particular needs:

> **LaTex Thesis Template Needs:**

> - EndNote Integration for people who use PubMed. EndNote has long been my citation manager, and this allows me the specific bibtex styles I wanted without all the extra stuff. 
> - Chapter labels at the top of the page. 
> - Spacing, footer and other header changes.

As such, I have modified the [MIT Latex Thesis](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/). Unfortunately, my "lorem ipsum" generator was on the fritz, so I did the next best thing I could think of and use actor Scott Caan and his likeness as placeholders.
